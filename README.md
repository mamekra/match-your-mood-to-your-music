Music serves as a powerful means of emotional expression, and song lyrics often capture a wide range of human sentiments. This project focuses on sentiment analysis of song lyrics (from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information) to develop an emotion-based song recommendation system. By analyzing lyrics, we aimed to classify songs into distinct emotional categories and recommend tracks based on user-selected moods.
To achieve this, we preprocessed and cleaned a large dataset of song lyrics, filtering non-English entries, removing noise, and normalizing text. Emotion labeling was performed using NRCLex, a lexicon-based approach that assigns predefined emotional scores to words. The labeled dataset was then used to train and compare multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
The evaluation of these models was based on accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, assessing their ability to classify lyrics according to dominant emotions. 
Challenges such as class imbalance and overlapping emotions in song lyrics presented difficulties in achieving high accuracy across all emotion categories. Future work could enhance classification by incorporating multi-label classification, attention mechanisms, and transformer-based embeddings. This study highlights the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in music sentiment analysis and lays the groundwork for advanced emotion-aware music recommendation systems.
